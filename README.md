# Installation of Softwares

## Pybullet

You can install PyBullet on your PC by following these steps:

1. **Install Python**: If you don't already have Python installed on your PC, you can download it from the official website https://www.python.org/downloads/. Make sure to select the version that matches your operating system.

2. **Install pip**: pip is a package manager for Python that makes it easy to install and manage Python packages. If you have a recent version of Python, pip should already be installed. You can check if pip is installed by running the command `pip --version` in a terminal or command prompt.

3. **Install PyBullet**: Once you have Python and pip installed, you can install PyBullet by running the command `pip install pybullet` in a terminal or command prompt. This will download and install the latest version of PyBullet and any necessary dependencies.

4. **Verify the installation**: To verify that PyBullet is installed correctly, you can run the following code in a Python console or a script:

```
import pybullet as p

# Create a PyBullet physics simulation
p.connect(p.GUI)
p.setGravity(0, 0, -9.81)
planeId = p.loadURDF("plane.urdf")

# Close the PyBullet simulation
p.disconnect()
```
If the installation was successful, you should see a PyBullet simulation window pop up, showing a simple plane. If you see any error messages, double-check that you have installed PyBullet correctly and that your system meets the requirements.
